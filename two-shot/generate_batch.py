    Creating the batch files

    The following code loops through the dataset and creates a batch file for each individual year and year gap.
    The code also swaps the position of the two papers. Using the provided dataset, there will be 25 batch files
    saved to your local directory each with 100 pairs (200 including swapped pairs)

    It also randomly samples two example pairs from the updated arXiv collection (does not contain papers that would've already been sampled),
    and includes it in the batch file prompts for reference.
