Your goal is to evaluate and compare the novelty of two research papers based on their titles and abstracts. The order in which the papers are presented is random and should not influence your evaluation.\n\nStep 1: Independent Evaluation\n\nAnalyze each research paper\u2019s title and abstract independently. Treat each paper as if it is the only one under review at that moment.\nRetrieve similar abstracts from a vector database based on the provided abstracts.\nContextual Date Analysis: Average the published dates of the retrieved documents. Use this average date as additional context for your evaluation.\nConsider that papers with an average date that is later or more recent in time are generally more novel.\nConsider the following aspects for each paper:\nNovelty of Methodology: Are the methods used new and innovative?\nSurprisingness of Findings: Are the findings unexpected or counterintuitive?\nImpact on Existing Knowledge: How does the research challenge or expand current scientific understanding?\nPotential for Future Research: Does the paper open up new directions for research?\nRelevance to 2024 Scientific Understanding: How well does the paper align with or push the boundaries of current trends?\nStep 2: Quantitative Assessment\n\nAssign a score from 1-10 to each research paper for its novelty, with 10 being the most novel. This score should be based on the content of the title and abstract, as well as the contextual information from the average published dates.\nProvide a brief justification for the score, using specific quotes and context.\nStep 3: Final Comparison\n\nAfter independently scoring each paper, compare the scores.\nDetermine which paper exhibits greater novelty based on the higher score, and conclude with: \"The more novel and impactful paper is [Paper X or Paper Y].\nImportant: The order of presentation is random and should not influence your decision. Evaluate each paper strictly on its content and merit, incorporating the additional context from the vector database as described."

Typically, these sensors generate large\nquantities of continuous data in a streaming fashion. Such vast amount of data\nmust be processed efficiently and securely, even under strong adversarial\nmodels. The recent introduction in the mass-market of consumer-grade processors\nwith Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, paves the way to\nimplement solutions that overcome less flexible approaches, such as those atop\nhomomorphic encryption. We present a secure streaming processing system built\non top of Intel SGX to showcase the viability of this approach with a system\nspecifically fitted for medical data. We design and fully implement a prototype\nsystem that we evaluate with several realistic datasets. Our experimental\nresults show that the proposed system achieves modest overhead compared to\nvanilla Spark while offering additional protection guarantees under powerful\nattackers and threat models.\n\nPaper Y Title: O$^2$TD: (Near)-Optimal Off-Policy TD Learning\nPaper Y Abstract:   Temporal difference learning and Residual Gradient methods are the most\nwidely used temporal difference based learning algorithms; however, it has been\nshown that none of their objective functions is optimal w.r.t approximating the\ntrue value function $V$. Two novel algorithms are proposed to approximate the\ntrue value function $V$. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) A\nbatch algorithm that can help find the approximate optimal off-policy\nprediction of the true value function $V$. (2) A linear computational cost (per\nstep) near-optimal algorithm that can learn from a collection of off-policy\nsamples. (3) A new perspective of the emphatic temporal difference learning\nwhich bridges the gap between off-policy optimality and off-policy stability.\n"
