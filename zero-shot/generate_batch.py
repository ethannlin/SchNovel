            Step 1: Identity the problem and solution that the research paper attempts to solve.
            Step 2: Determine how unique the solution is given the current research landscape in 2024. Does the paper introduce a new idea, theory, or concept that has not been previously discussed in literature?
            Step 3: Determine how creative the solution is given the current research landscape in 2024. Does it apply a known idea in a completely new context or in a way that has not been done before?
            Step 4: Using the findings from steps 1-3, determine which paper is more novel.
            In your response please only state which paper is move novel. (e.g. 1 if paper 1 is more novel; 2 if paper 2 is more novel)'''

    Creating the batch files

    The following code loops through the dataset and creates a batch file for each individual year and year gap.
    The code also swaps the position of the two papers. Using the provided dataset, there will be 25 batch files
    saved to your local directory each with 100 pairs (200 including swapped pairs)
